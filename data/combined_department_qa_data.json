In the year 1984, based on the recommendations of a high level committee, the department of Agricultural Engineering was reorganised and Department of SWCE became as an independent department along with three other departments. The Department of SWCE offers B Tech UG programs jointly while M Tech and Ph D programs are offered independently. The department is privileged to have a mix of senior and younger highly competent faculty. As per mandate, the department is actively involved in Teaching, Research and extension activities. It has good facilities including several laboratories and computing facilities. *   [Pantnagar Technology Alumni Association](http://ptaa-gbpuat.com/) *   [Engineering & Technology Society](http://www.gbpuat-tech.ac.in/ETS/index.html) *   [Pantnagar Technology Alumni Association](http://www.gbpuat-tech.ac.in/ptaa.php?id=1) *   [Internal Notices and Circulars](http://www.gbpuat-tech.ac.in/announcement.php?id=1) Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture and Technology, **Disclaimer:** The facts published on this website are for immediate information only and no legal claim can be made for any damage caused by using the content of this site.
