These should be fully utilized to ascertain and redress the genuine difficulties of student. What binds together students and teachers is the deep and creative partnership in the sharing of common interest, mutual regard & sense of values and working together for their main purpose, which is the pursuit of knowledge and discovery. Any one who is not committed to this philosophy or prepared to honour it has really no place in an institution of higher education”.\nThat in any consequence, I believe that all grievances, disputes and problems of the students should be settled by constitutional means, such as approach to the Advisor, Warden, Chief Warden, Dean, Vice-Chancellor or other individuals concerned or by raising them in the relevant committees, such as Central Food Advisory Committee, Professional Societies, Cultural Societies, etc. or by reference to the Board of Management, Chancellor or the State Govt. or if all other means fail by having recourse to Court of justice.\nThat I, further believe that under no circumstances, there is need or justification for any defiance of the Rules and Regulations of the University, show of force, unruly demonstration, coercion, violence or any other means forming part of the so called direct action. I promise that I shall never have recourse to and unconstitutional means.\nThat I, further believe that under no circumstances, there is justification for any student approaching any outsider, may be the agitators from the Universities, politicians or disgruntled individuals not concerned with the affairs of the University. All matters should be settled by those concerned with the affairs of the University such as the students and staff of the University, guardians of the students, members of the Board of Management, the State Government, Chancellor, etc. I shall accordingly refrain from approaching any outside element not concerned with affairs of the University.\nThat, I shall attend my classes and participate in other activities of the University according to the programme, irrespective of the fact whether my other colleagues do so or not and that I shall do so even in the face of intimidation by any of them.\nThat, I further declare that any activity/travelling connected with studies/courses/project etc. will be entirely on my risk and responsibility and in case of accident or mishap the University or any of the functionary will not be responsible for that.\nI also affirm that I shall abide by the word and spirit of the above declaration and further undertake that if, at any time I am found indulging in any such activity I may be dismissed from the University.\nGuardian‟s Signature ....................................\tStudent‟s Signature .......................................\nName in Block Letters...................................\tName in Block Letters ..................................\nPlace ...................................\tPlace ...........................................\nDate....................................\tDate ............................................\nAppendix-V AFFIDAVIT BY THE STUDENT FOR NON PARTICIPATION IN RAGGING\nI.
