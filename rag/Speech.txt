Long years ago, we made a tryst with destiny, and now the time comes when we shall redeem our pledge, not wholly or in full measure, but very substantially.

At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the newâ€”when an age ends, and when the soul of a nation, long suppressed, finds utterance.

It is fitting that at this solemn moment, we take the pledge of dedication to the service of India and her people and to the still larger cause of humanity.

To the people of India, whose representatives we are, we make an appeal to join us with faith and confidence in this great adventure. The future beckons to us. Where do we go and what shall be our endeavor? To bring freedom and opportunity to the common man, to fight and end poverty and ignorance, and to build a strong, independent, and peaceful nation.

This is no time for petty and destructive criticism, no time for ill will or blaming others. We have to build the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell.

Jai Hind!
