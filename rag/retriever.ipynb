The Govind Ballabh Pant University of Agriculture & Technology was established in 1960 by an Act \\nof the State Legislature of Uttar Pradesh, enacted in 1958. The objectives of the University, as \\noutlined in the Act are: - \\n(a) making provision for the education of rural people of the State in different branches of study, \\nparticularly agriculture, rural industry, business and other allied subjects; \\n(b) furthering the prosecution of research, particularly in agriculture and other allied sciences; and  \\n(c) undertaking field and extension programmes. \\n2. This is purely a residential University. All students should reside in the hostels in main campus.  \\n3. The University ensures individual attention to each and every student through its advisory system. \\nThe advisory system is supplemented by a system of student counsellors. For each group of 15 to \\n20 first-degree students, a teacher advisor is appointed. At postgraduate level, for each student, an \\nadvisory committee, consisting of 3 -4 teachers is appointed. The teacher -advisor guides, \\nsupervises and monitors the academic performance of his/her advisees beside s helping them in \\ntheir personal problems. He/She also maintains a close contact with parent/guardians of his/her \\nadvisees. \\n4. The structure and objective envisaged for the University represent a departure from the system of \\neducation prevalent in the country , which had essentially scholastic orientation.

The imperative is reflected in both the character of the faculties and \\ndepartments as well as in the establishment of Directorates of Experiment Station and Extension \\nEducation, which are expected to take a holistic view of develop ment and ensure not only inter -\\ndisciplinary research but also synthesize ideas emanating from different Colleges. \\n5.

Pant University of Agriculture & Technology, Pantnagar hereby affirm: \\n \\n1. That I firmly believe in the basic philosophy outlined in paragraph 11.75 of the Second Education \\nCommission, particularly that quoted below: \\n“A University or a College is an academic fellowship of equals where things can be discussed and \\ndecided reasonably by the joint committees of teachers and students which we have recommended \\nhave this purpose specifically in view.  These should be fully utilized to as certain and redress the \\ngenuine difficulties of student. What binds together students and teachers is the deep and creative \\npartnership in the sharing of common interest, mutual regard & sense of values and working together \\nfor their main purpose, which is  the pursuit of knowledge and discovery. Any one who is not \\ncommitted to this philosophy or prepared to honour it has really no place in an institution of higher \\neducation”. \\n2. That in any consequence, I believe that all grievances, disputes and problems of the students should \\nbe settled by constitutional means, such as approach to the Advisor, Warden, Chief Warden, Dean, \\nVice-Chancellor or other individuals concerned or by raising them in the relevant committees, such \\nas Central Food Advisory Committee, Professional Societies, Cultural Societies, etc. or by reference \\nto the Board of Management, Chancellor or the State Govt. or if all other means fail by having \\nrecourse to Court of justice. \\n3. That I, further believe that under no circumstances, there is need or j ustification for any defiance of \\nthe Rules and Regulations of the University, show of force, unruly demonstration, coercion, violence \\nor any other means forming part of the so called direct action. I promise that I shall never have \\nrecourse to and unconstitutional means. \\n4. That I, further believe that under no circumstances, there is justification for any student approaching any \\noutsider, may be the agitators from the Universities, politicians or disgruntled individuals not concerned \\nwith the affairs of the University. All matters should be settled by those concerned with the affairs of the \\nUniversity such as the students and staff of the University, guardians of the students, members of the \\nBoard of Management, the State Government, Chancellor, etc. I shall a ccordingly refrain from \\napproaching any outside element not concerned with affairs of the University. \\n5. That, I shall attend my classes and participate in other activities of the University according to the \\nprogramme, irrespective of the fact whether my othe r colleagues do so or not and that I shall do so \\neven in the face of intimidation by any of them. \\n6. That, I further declare that any activity/travelling connected with studies/courses/project etc. will be \\nentirely on my risk and responsibility and in case of  accident or mishap the University or any of the \\nfunctionary will not be responsible for that. \\n7. I also affirm that I shall abide by the word and spirit of the above declaration and further undertake \\nthat if, at any time I am found indulging in any such activity I may be dismissed from the University. \\n \\n \\nGuardian‟s Signature ....................................
